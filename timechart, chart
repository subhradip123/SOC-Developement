timechart:
It is similar like stats command.
It will show values on time interval, when the log is genereted.

| timechart <stats_func> by <field name>

By default
if the query runs for 24 hours, timechart will have interval of 30 mins.
if the query runs for 60 mins, timechart will have interval of 1 min.
if the query runs for 15 min, timechart will have interval of 10 sec.

attribute to ustomize the interval:

| timechart <span=..> <stats_func> by <field name>

s--> sec
m-->min
h-->hour
d-->day
w-->week
mon-->month

span=1s
span=1d

in stats command we can use multiple splite by fields but in timechart we can use only one split by field.
in stats and timechart we can use multiple functions.


what is the others and null in timechart command?


chart:

chart <stats_func> over <field_name_1> by <field_name_2>

field_name_1 will come across row.
field_name_2 will come across column.
