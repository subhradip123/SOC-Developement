Eval: (evaluate)
We can use mathetical logics with eval command.

| eval "new_field_name" = logic 

| eval "new_field_name1" = logic 1, "new_field_name2"=logic 2, "new_field_name3"= logic 3 


Concatinate:
Use to concatinate two values one beside another.

| eval "new" =<field_name 1>.<field_name 2>
field_name 1field_name 2

| eval"new" = Kapil.Sai
KapilSai

| eval "name" = Kapil."space".Abc
Kapil Abc.

. is used to concatinate two field values.
If we want to use space or any symbol then have to to put it inside"...."

Round up a number:
| eval "new_field" = round(field_name,<digit>) [round up to degit]
                   = round(field_name)  [round up to zero decimal]
				   

Lower case/upper case:
| eval "new_field_name" = lower(field_name)
| eval "new_field_name" = upper(field_name)


length of a field value(how many letter or digits are there in that field value)
| eval "new_field"= len(field name)
