What is the difference between top and head command?


Kapil is 25 years old.
Dibyangsu lives in Chennai.
kapil like red.
SAi is 24 years old.
Mustafa likes green.
Kapil lives in Banglore.
Mustafa works with splunk tech.

Kapil happens 3 times, so in top command it will return 3.
Mustatfa happens 2 times..........................returen 2.


Head do not calcualate anything.
It just took the 1st 10 values from list and return it.
